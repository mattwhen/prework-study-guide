# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
  The motivation behind this study guide is to give new developers a study guide when learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Github.
  

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  This project was created for new developers who aren't sure exactly where to start or what the guidelines they need to follow to learn Web Dev. 
  
  
- What problem does it solve?
  The Prework Study Guide provides quick useful information they can refer to during their coding journey, all in one place.
  
- What did you learn?
  I became familiar with structoring a webpage, by using the section element to separate the different topics that are being learned in the guide. 
  Also, writing code should be written neatly and precise for other developers to read and follow.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
