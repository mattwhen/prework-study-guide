# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
  The motivation behind this study guide is to give new developers a study guide when learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Github.
  

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
  This project was created for new developers who aren't sure exactly where to start or what the guidelines they need to follow to learn Web Dev. 
  
  
- What problem does it solve?
  The Prework Study Guide provides quick useful information they can refer to during their coding journey, all in one place.
  
- What did you learn?
  I became familiar with structoring a webpage, by using the section element to separate the different topics that are being learned in the guide. 
  Also, writing code should be written neatly and precise for other developers to read and follow.
