        <li>Became familiar with Git and Github, but also what their differences are.
          Git: Git is a Version Control system that manages and keeps track of changes you make in your code.
          Github: Github is a cloud based solution that lets you manage Git repositories (basically repositories are a
          place where you store all your files and revision history).
        </li>
        <li>Learned how to create branches</li>
        <li>Use the command git checkout main to switch to the main branch.</li>
        <li>Pulldown the latest branch using git pull origin main.</li>
        <li>Learned how to stage the changes we made in the working branch by using the git add -A command</li>
        <li>Learned after staging changes made, we can commit them to our repositories using the command git commit -m
          "added HTML". Where the -m is the message we want to add followed by a brief description of what was added.
        </li>
        <li>Learned how to sync my local branch with the main branch in Github. Using the following command in the
